  <h1>An Interview</h1>
     <div class="question-container">
         <div class="question"> <span class="jas"> J </span> : If you were a pizza delivery man, how would you benefit from scissors? </div>

         <div class="answer">R : If it's a scissor in an alternate universe, I’d use it to “cut” the delivery time in half for more tips. If not I’d start a side hustle as a hairdresser because delivering pizza doesn’t pay enough. </div>
     </div>

      <div class="question-container1">
      	<div class="question1"> <span class="jas"> J </span>: How lucky are you and why?

      	<div class="answer1">R : I wouldn’t consider myself lucky. Luck refers to things by chance so I’d probably say I’m more blessed instead. </div>
     </div>


        <div class="question-container2">
      	<div class="question2"> <span class="jas"> J </span>: Are you more of a hunter or a gatherer?


      	<div class="answer2">R : I’m probably neither, but if I had to choose, I would be a gatherer. I personally don’t have energy or hand-eye coordination for hunting.

      	<div class="question3"> <span class="jas"> J </span>: If you were on an island and could only bring three things, what would you bring?

     </div>

           <div class="question-container4">
      	<div class="question4"> <span class="jas"> J </span>: Do you believe in God?


      	<div class="answer4">R : I’d say I believe God exists. My parents are Christian and I grew up in a Christian household. I’m still unsure about my faith though.  </div>
     </div>

           <div class="question-container5">
      	<div class="question5"> <span class="jas"> J </span>: Why is a tennis ball a sphere?

      	<div class="answer5">R : I don’t really know the physics behind it (I’m an art major), but I think it's so that there’s no limit in the direction the ball bounces.
 </div>
     </div>

           <div class="question-container6">
      	<div class="question6"> <span class="jas"> J </span>: How lucky are you and why?

        <div class="question7"> <span class="jas"> J </span>: How would you use Yelp to find the number of businesses in the U.S?

        <div class="answer7">R : I don’t think I would be able to find the number of businesses in the U.S from Yelp. I don’t think a lot of businesses are even on Yelp.</div>
     </div>

                <div class="question-container8">
        <div class="question8"> <span class="jas"> J </span>: How lucky are you and why?

        <div class="answer8">R : I wouldn’t consider myself lucky. Luck refers to things by chance so I’d probably say I’m more blessed instead. </div>
     </div>

                <div class="question-container9">
        <div class="question9"> <span class="jas"> J </span>: How honest are you?

        <div class="answer9">R :  I’d say I have different honestly “levels” based on the given situation.

        <div class="answer10">R : According to vault.com from Google, 200 million sq ft a month, so that’s about 2 billion, 400 million sq ft a year. </div>

        <div class="question11"> <span class="jas"> J </span>: Can you instruct someone how to make an origami 'cootie catcher' with just words?

        <div class="answer11">R : Not sure what a “cootie catcher” is. Nevermind, just googled it.  I know it as a “fortune teller” and I would be able to. </div>
